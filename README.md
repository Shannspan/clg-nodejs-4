CLG Node JS Lesson 4

* Initialise a new NPM folder called 'myAPI'

* Create a local server using express that listens to port '3000'

* Build a response that retruns 'hello world' on the route path http:/localhost:3000/

* Now modify the middleware to add a new route 'firstServer' and display a message,
    "Hi there! This is my first route built using express framework."

* Now modify the middleware to add a route that will accept 'firstUser/:id' and display
    the message, "Hi there you user id is..."

* Now modify your code to handle a route that does not exist. Return a 404 page for a route that's not handled eg. '/noroute'

* Run the code through your terminal

* Exit Node.js
